Jake and Shilpa decided to write a program to rewrite The Good Place finale, because it was awful and they think their program can do a better job.

IDEA BOARD:

1. Parsing screencaps from the episode

I think it'd be cool if we took screencaps from each episode, maybe once per 10 seconds or 30 seconds or something, and converted it to a .ppm (see code below). We could then parse the images pixel by pixel, get the color, and determine the emotion of the image based on most colors present, THEN match up corresponding emotional words to that screencap.

We can use the images as an extra parameter to determine our new script's sentence structure (i.e determining the sentence recipes).

In addition to using the "emotions of images" to create the script's new sentences, we can also come up with some cool randomized algorithm to do whatever. maybe like every 3rd+x sentence is a pensive sentence, every e^yth sentence is an angry one, etc.
